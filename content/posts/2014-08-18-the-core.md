Another p5js/Codepen.io experiment. This time playing around with  [contours](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginContour) and  [lerp](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerpColor) to get gradient fills inside a polygon.



I've been trying to learn a bit more about easing functions. More specifically elastic easing. It is fairly easy to do a single bounce with CSS. Tools such as  [bounce.js](http://bouncejs.com/#{s:[{T:"c",e:"b",d:1000,D:0,f:{x:1,y:1},t:{x:2,y:1},s:1,b:4},{T:"c",e:"b",d:1000,D:0,f:{x:1,y:1},t:{x:1,y:2},s:1,b:6}]}) can be used to generate more complex versions. However, I had no idea how to do this with JS or what the underlying equations were &hellip;

  <p>Despite the commonality of the classic easing equations, largely attributed to Penner, there doesn’t seem to be the in-depth examination of “how it works” that a lot of code is subject to nowadays.</p>

We start with this basic equation where:

- `t` is the current time (or position) of the tween. This can be seconds or frames, steps, seconds, ms, whatever – as long as the unit is the same as is used for the total time.
- `b` is the beginning value of the property.
- `c` is the change between the beginning and destination value of the property.
- `d` is the total time of the tween.

{% highlight js %}
function noEasing (t, b, c, d) {
	return c * t / d + b;
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then use polynomial functions to create all kinds of easing effects:

{% highlight js %}
function bounce(t, b, c, d) {
  var ts=(t/=d)*t;
  var tc=ts*t;
  return b+c*(33*tc*ts + -106*ts*ts + 126*tc + -67*ts + 15*t);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Tim Groleau built this a really cool  [Easing Function Generator](http://www.timotheegroleau.com/Flash/experiments/easing_function_generator.htm) which I used to generate the bounce easing function.
