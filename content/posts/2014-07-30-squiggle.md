I've been obsessed with this  [illustration](https://dribbble.com/shots/1128300-Jupiter-Study-no-01) for a while now and really want to build an animated/generative version of it. But, as usual I have no idea how to do that.

The aim is to get those paths to flow across the screen with an organic movement. Which probably means using a 2D  [Perlin noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) field. This is just a first step towards animating Jupiter.

Next step is figuring out how to make those tentacle like paths. Probably using  [spline extrusions](http://marcinignac.com/blog/cindermedusae-making-generative-creatures/mesh05.html).

Built using  [Joseph Gentle's noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) library and  [Two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js) for the graphics.
