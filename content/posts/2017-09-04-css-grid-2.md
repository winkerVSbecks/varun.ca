In part one I introduced the CSS Grid Layout Module. We covered some basic terminology and talked about how to create layouts by placing items onto a `grid-area`.

Let's start with quick refresher. Grid Area is the space created by the intersection of four grid lines. We define it in terms of start and end points for columns and rows.

{% include diagrams/grid-area-define.html %}

In this post I am going to introduce another approach to creating grid based layouts – using _grid template areas_.

## Grid Template Areas
This property allows us to divide the grid into named areas which can then be referenced for placing items. We start by declaring the names in the `grid-template-areas` property. Once declared we can use them as keywords in any of the [grid-placement properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#grid-placement-property).

We are still defining grid areas however instead of providing row/column start & end points we are doing it through a layout template.

{% include diagrams/named-grid-areas.html %}

You'll notice that the syntax of the `grid-template-areas` property provides a visualization of the grid structure. This makes it relatively easy to understand the layout. To place items onto this grid we can use `grid-area` property. For example: `grid-area: header;` or `grid-area: content;`, etc.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="26435" data-slug-hash="BZvMbM" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="winkerVSbecks" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Named Grid Areas – step 1" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks/pen/BZvMbM/">Named Grid Areas – step 1</a> by Varun Vachhar (<a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks">@winkerVSbecks</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

The `grid-template-areas` property allows us to define the shape of the layout, but not the sizing. By default the sizing is dependant on grid items placed within them. You can pair `grid-template-areas` with other properties such as `grid-template-rows` & `grid-template-columns` to control the sizing of the areas too!

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="26435" data-slug-hash="pwqyYj" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="winkerVSbecks" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Named Grid Areas" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks/pen/pwqyYj/">Named Grid Areas</a> by Varun Vachhar (<a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks">@winkerVSbecks</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

## Example 1 – Magazine Style Layout

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="26435" data-slug-hash="KmoxJp" data-default-tab="result" data-user="winkerVSbecks" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS Grid Magazine Style Layout" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks/pen/KmoxJp/">CSS Grid Magazine Style Layout</a> by Varun Vachhar (<a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks">@winkerVSbecks</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The above is a magazine style layout of <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1424/hawaii-s-online-gaming-curse">Hawaii's Online Gaming Curse</a> article from The Outline – built using both CSS Grid and [multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts). Below is a schematic of what the layout looks like at the three break points.

{% include diagrams/magazine-layout.html %}

Given this was one of the first grid layouts I ever built I made some assumptions which later turned out to be false. I defined the `grid-template-areas` for all three breakpoints using the same number of columns. While you _can_ do this you don't have to. You can completely modify the template by changing the values for the `grid-template-areas`, `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`. The other option you have is to change the area that an element is placed in. More on that in the next example.


## Example 2 – BBC Sport Live Football

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="26435" data-slug-hash="RgRomv" data-default-tab="result" data-user="winkerVSbecks" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="BBC Live Football Coverage (CSS Grid)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks/pen/RgRomv/">BBC Live Football Coverage (CSS Grid)</a> by Varun Vachhar (<a href="https://codepen.io/winkerVSbecks">@winkerVSbecks</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

For this example I recreated the [BBC Sport Live Reporting](http://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/38322056) page. Below you can see the schematic for the large breakpoint layout on the right and its grid template representation on the left. And yes, you can use [emoji](https://una.im/css-grid/#💁) for template area names!

{% include diagrams/bbc-sport-live.html %}

In the main content area there are three columns: summary (👀), live-reporting (📻) & stats/line-up (📊/🤼🏽‍). To centre this content I placed an unnamed spacer on either side. You can define [unnamed areas](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#grid-template-areas-null-cell-token) using a sequence of one or more `.`.

At the medium break point live-reporting (📻), stats (📊) & line-up (🤼) get collapsed into a tab based interface (📋). We can do this by placing those items in the `📋` grid-area instead. And for the small breakpoint things collapse further.

{% include diagrams/bbc-sport-live-tabs.html %}

Each entry in the live-reporting (📻) section is also using a grid layout, but I'll let you discover that by reading through the code.

## Conclusion

One of the main takeaways for me from these experiments was that CSS Grid removes the need for wrapper elements to create layouts. This flattens the markup and the main _blocks_ of content generally end up being direct descendants of the grid container i.e. grid-items. Or at least, we should aim to have them be grid items. This then allows us to drastically modify how the content will be displayed by moving items anywhere within the grid.

You can find all my CSS Grid experiments in this [CodePen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/nZBOPV). Also, I would highly recommend reading the [CSS Grid Spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/). It has a lot of amazing examples, detailed explanation of all concepts and it is not as daunting as you would think.
