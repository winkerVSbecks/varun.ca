After several years of using Jekyll, I switched over my website to Gatsby. Jekyll worked great for most things. The part that I struggled with most was adding interactivity. The best I could do was embed CodePen blocks in markdown. Gatsby gives you all the benefits of static rendering and craft amazing interactive experiences with React. Josh Comeau's [Dynamic Bézier Curves post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/posts/dynamic-bezier-curves/) or Rodrigo Pombo's [crollycoding](https://deploy-preview-3--pomber.netlify.com/build-your-own-react) are good examples of this. There is much out there about [migrating to Gatsby](https://julesforrest.com/moving-to-gatsby), the benefits and the trade-offs. I want to focus on one particular challenge of my migration — dark mode.

Dark themes are certainly a bit of a trend, but it also happens to be a feature many users rely on on a day-to-day basis. Most devices support it at the OS level. The user preference even cascades down to the browser and can be captured in CSS via the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

## Colour Palette

The first step was to pick a colour palette. Inverting shades using `filter: invert(100%)` is a quick and somewhat hacky way to get to dark mode. You can follow [Daniel Eden's](https://mobile.twitter.com/_dte) advice and pair it with `hue-rotate(180deg)` for a better result, it compensates for the hue inversion. However, there is a lot more it. Inverting hues can lead to unintended consiquences such as poor contrast or shiting visual importance of UI elements. We need to be a lot more intentional about the colour palettle.

I'm using [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) for components with the following structure for the colour palette. For most things such as text and surface colours I am using the neutral scale. Brand colours are used for highlights and accents.

```js
{
  colors: {
    brand: {
      main: '#ffcccc',
      bright: '#ffeecc',
      faded: '#48434f',
      selection: '#959090',
    },
    neutral: {
      0: 'rgb(217, 215, 224)',
      1: '#ccc',
      2: '#aaa',
      3: '#777',
      4: '#555',
      5: '#333',
      6: '#222',
      7: 'rgb(19, 18, 23)',
    },
  }
}
```

Teresa Man shared extremely valuable and actionable advice in her post [How to design delightful dark themes](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-design-delightful-dark-themes-7b3da644ff1f).

Avoid pure black or white. It can lead to eye fatigue and causes [black smearing](https://twitter.com/marcedwards/status/1053519077958803456).

<ColorScale />

1. Darken distant surfaces
2. Reduce large blocks of bright color
3. Avoid pure black or white

I've seen a lot of people use `filter: invert(100%)` to . There is a lot more to consider.

Just add `hue-rotate(180deg)` to at least compensate for the hue inversion! https://codepen.io/daneden/pen/bGbWrpg

and not think too deeply about colours. In my o

- Picking colors — super high contrast issues
  - not `filter: invert(1)` However, it is difficult to create a delightful dark theme. We cannot simply reuse our colors or invert our shades.
  - `filter: invert(100%)` can be a hacky/cheap way to get a “dark mode” UI, but it obviously inverts colors too. Just add `hue-rotate(180deg)` to at least compensate for the hue inversion! https://codepen.io/daneden/pen/bGbWrpg
- Impact — syntax highlighting, shadows, every feature.
- Theme.js, Colour naming
- First load
  — check for prefers-color-scheme: dark
  - tracking user choice
  - avoiding flash on first load with pre-render
    - Convert colors to CSS Variables
    - Change CSS Variables based on theme
