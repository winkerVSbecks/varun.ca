It all started with a tweet.

## What is lerp?

Lerp is a function that interpolates between two values using the parameter `t`. Where `t` is expected to be between `[0, 1]` range. It's super handy for interpolating between colors or creating keyframed animations.

When you're working with a draw loop, you get three timing variables:

1. `deltaTime`: the time elapsed since the last frame
2. `time`: the time elapsed since the beginning of the draw loop
3. `playHead`: the time elapsed since the beginning of the draw loop, but normalized to the range `[0, 1]`

`playHead` works perfectly as the `t` parameter for `lerp` function. Here's an example of how you can use it to animate the x position of a circle:

```js
const xStart = width * 0.25;
const xEnd = width * 0.75;
const y = height * 0.5;

function draw({ playhead }) {
  const x = lerp(xStart, xEnd, t);
  circle(x, y, radius / 2, 'white');
}
```

## What is damp?

```js
const x = width * 0.25;
const xEnd = width * 0.75;
const y = height * 0.5;

function draw({ deltaTime }) {
  x = damp(x, xEnd, 3, deltaTime);
  circle(x, y, radius / 2, 'white');
}
```
