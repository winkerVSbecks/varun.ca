I love triangles!

Last year I spent 30 days making a new  [triangle every day](http://winkervsbecks.github.io/a-triangle-everyday). It was a great experience. I learnt so much and it was amazing how much you can do with just one simple shape.

After a brief hiatus I have decided to get back to constructing more triangles. You can follow the progress at  [triangle.life](http://triangle.life).

In case you are wondering त्रिकोण is the Hindi word for triangle.
